This site contains the project documentation for the Final Project "CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python".  
It is a script that synchronize events in Google Calendars.

Requirements:  

- Project must be implemented in Python.
- Project must have a ```main``` function and three or more additional functions. At least three of those additional funtions must be accompanied by test that can be executed with pytest.
    - Your ```main``` function must be in a file called ```project.py```, which should be in the “root” (i.e., top-level folder) of your project.
    - Your 3 required custom functions other than ```main``` must also be in ```project.py``` and defined at the same indentation level as ```main``` (i.e., not nested under any classes or functions).
    - Your test functions must be in a file called ```test_project.py```, which should also be in the “root” of your project. Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with ```test_``` (```test_custom_function```, for example, where ```custom_function``` is a function you’ve implemented in ```project.py```).
    - You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
- Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.
- Any ```pip```-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called ```requirements.txt``` in the root of your project.
